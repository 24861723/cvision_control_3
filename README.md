# cvision_control_3
 CVision Control, a program that allows the user to control system brightness and volume using hand gestures. The code is made for members of the Stellenbosch University A.I Society, but is available to the public. All contributions are welcome.

 The image below shows the current user interface. There are two challenges detailed in the source code, one of which is to improve the user interface.

Below are all the project dependencies required to run the code:

1. **OpenCV (cv2)**:
    - Install OpenCV for computer vision:
      ```
      pip install opencv-python
      ```

2. **NumPy**:
    - Install NumPy for numerical computations:
      ```
      pip install numpy
      ```

3. **pycaw**:
    - Install pycaw for audio control on Windows:
      ```
      pip install pycaw
      ```

4. **screen_brightness_control**:
    - Install screen-brightness-control to adjust monitor brightness:
